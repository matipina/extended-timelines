Alan Turing
Alan Mathison Turing (/ˈtjʊərɪŋ/; 23 June 1912 – 7
June 1954) was an English mathematician, computer
scientist, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher and
theoretical biologist.
[5] He was highly influential in the
development of theoretical computer science,
providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm
and computation with the Turing machine, which can
be considered a model of a general-purpose
computer.
[6][7][8] Turing is widely considered to be the
father of theoretical computer science.[9]
Born in London, Turing was raised in southern
England. He graduated from King's College,
Cambridge, and in 1938, earned a doctorate degree
from Princeton University. During World War II,
Turing worked for the Government Code and Cypher
School at Bletchley Park, Britain's codebreaking centre
that produced Ultra intelligence. He led Hut 8, the
section responsible for German naval cryptanalysis.
Turing devised techniques for speeding the breaking of
German ciphers, including improvements to the prewar Polish bomba method, an electromechanical
machine that could find settings for the Enigma
machine. He played a crucial role in cracking
intercepted messages that enabled the Allies to defeat
the Axis powers in the Battle of the Atlantic and other
engagements.[10][11]
After the war, Turing worked at the National Physical
Laboratory, where he designed the Automatic
Computing Engine, one of the first designs for a
stored-program computer. In 1948, Turing joined Max
Newman's Computing Machine Laboratory at the
University of Manchester, where he contributed to the
development of early Manchester computers[12] and
became interested in mathematical biology. Turing
wrote on the chemical basis of morphogenesis[13][1]
and predicted oscillating chemical reactions such as the
Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction, first observed in the
mathematical and theoretical
biology

fully recognised during his lifetime because much of
his work was covered by the Official Secrets Act.
[14]
In 1952, Turing was prosecuted for homosexual acts.
He accepted hormone treatment, a procedure
commonly referred to as chemical castration, as an
alternative to prison. Turing died on 7 June 1954, aged
41, from cyanide poisoning. An inquest determined his
death as suicide, but the evidence is also consistent
with accidental poisoning.[15] Following a campaign in
2009, British prime minister Gordon Brown made an
official public apology for "the appalling way [Turing]
was treated". Queen Elizabeth II granted a pardon in
2013. The term "Alan Turing law" is used informally
to refer to a 2017 law in the UK that retroactively
pardoned men cautioned or convicted under historical
legislation that outlawed homosexual acts.[16]
Turing left an extensive legacy in mathematics and
computing which has become widely recognised with
statues and many things named after him, including an
annual award for computing innovation. His portrait
appears on the Bank of England £50 note, first released
on 23 June 2021 to coincide with his birthday. The audience vote in a 2019 BBC series named Turing the
greatest scientist of the 20th century.
Turing was born in Maida Vale, London, while his father, Julius
Mathison Turing, was on leave from his position with the Indian Civil
Service (ICS) of the British Raj government at Chatrapur, then in the
Madras Presidency and presently in Odisha state, in India.
[17][18]
Turing's father was the son of a clergyman, the Rev. John Robert
Turing, from a Scottish family of merchants that had been based in the
Netherlands and included a baronet. Turing's mother, Julius's wife, was
Ethel Sara Turing (née Stoney), daughter of Edward Waller Stoney,
chief engineer of the Madras Railways. The Stoneys were a Protestant
Anglo-Irish gentry family from both County Tipperary and County
Longford, while Ethel herself had spent much of her childhood in
County Clare.
[19]
Julius and Ethel married on 1 October 1907 at the
Church of Ireland St. Bartholomew's Church on Clyde Road in
Ballsbridge, Dublin.
[20]
Early life and education
Family
Turing at age 16, c. 1928 – c. 1929
Julius's work with the ICS brought the family to British India, where his grandfather had been a general
in the Bengal Army. However, both Julius and Ethel wanted their children to be brought up in Britain, so
they moved to Maida Vale,
[21] London, where Alan Turing was born on 23 June 1912, as recorded by a
blue plaque on the outside of the house of his birth,[22][23]
later the Colonnade Hotel.
[17][24] Turing had
an elder brother, John Ferrier Turing, father of Dermot Turing, 12th Baronet of the Turing baronets.
[25]
In
1922, he discovered Natural Wonders Every Child Should Know by Edwin Tenney Brewster. He credited
it with opening his eyes to science.[26]
Turing's father's civil service commission was still active during Turing's childhood years, and his parents
travelled between Hastings in the United Kingdom[27] and India, leaving their two sons to stay with a
retired Army couple. At Hastings, Turing stayed at Baston Lodge, Upper Maze Hill, St Leonards-on-Sea,
now marked with a blue plaque.[28] The plaque was unveiled on 23 June 2012, the centenary of Turing's
birth.[29]
Very early in life, Turing's parents purchased a house in Guildford in 1927, and Turing lived there during
school holidays. The location is also marked with a blue plaque.[30]
Turing's parents enrolled him at St Michael's, a primary
school at 20 Charles Road, St Leonards-on-Sea, from the age
of six to nine. The headmistress recognised his talent, noting
that she "...had clever boys and hardworking boys, but Alan is
a genius".[31]
Between January 1922 and 1926, Turing was educated at
Hazelhurst Preparatory School, an independent school in the
village of Frant in Sussex (now East Sussex).[32]
In 1926, at
the age of 13, he went on to Sherborne School,
[33] an
independent boarding school in the market town of Sherborne
in Dorset, where he boarded at Westcott House. The first day
of term coincided with the 1926 General Strike, in Britain,
but Turing was so determined to attend that he rode his
bicycle unaccompanied 60 miles (97 km) from Southampton
to Sherborne, stopping overnight at an inn.[34]
Turing's natural inclination towards mathematics and science
did not earn him respect from some of the teachers at
Sherborne, whose definition of education placed more
emphasis on the classics. His headmaster wrote to his parents: "I hope he will not fall between two stools.
If he is to stay at public school, he must aim at becoming educated. If he is to be solely a Scientific
Specialist, he is wasting his time at a public school".[35] Despite this, Turing continued to show
remarkable ability in the studies he loved, solving advanced problems in 1927 without having studied
even elementary calculus. In 1928, aged 16, Turing encountered Albert Einstein's work; not only did he
grasp it, but it is possible that he managed to deduce Einstein's questioning of Newton's laws of motion
from a text in which this was never made explicit.[36]
School
At Sherborne, Turing formed a significant friendship with fellow pupil Christopher Collan Morcom (13
July 1911 – 13 February 1930),[37] who has been described as Turing's first love.[38][39][40] Their
relationship provided inspiration in Turing's future endeavours, but it was cut short by Morcom's death, in
February 1930, from complications of bovine tuberculosis, contracted after drinking infected cow's milk
some years previously.
[41][42][43]
The event caused Turing great sorrow. He coped with his grief by working that much harder on the topics
of science and mathematics that he had shared with Morcom. In a letter to Morcom's mother, Frances
Isobel Morcom (née Swan), Turing wrote:
I am sure I could not have found anywhere another companion so brilliant and yet so charming
and unconceited. I regarded my interest in my work, and in such things as astronomy (to which
he introduced me) as something to be shared with him and I think he felt a little the same about
me ... I know I must put as much energy if not as much interest into my work as if he were
alive, because that is what he would like me to do.[44]
Turing's relationship with Morcom's mother continued long after Morcom's death, with her sending gifts
to Turing, and him sending letters, typically on Morcom's birthday.
[45] A day before the third anniversary
of Morcom's death (13 February 1933), he wrote to Mrs. Morcom:
I expect you will be thinking of Chris when this reaches you. I shall too, and this letter is just to
tell you that I shall be thinking of Chris and of you tomorrow. I am sure that he is as happy now
as he was when he was here. Your affectionate Alan.[46]
Some have speculated that Morcom's death was the cause of Turing's atheism and materialism.
[47]
Apparently, at this point in his life he still believed in such concepts as a spirit, independent of the body
and surviving death. In a later letter, also written to Morcom's mother, Turing wrote:
Personally, I believe that spirit is really eternally connected with matter but certainly not by the
same kind of body ... as regards the actual connection between spirit and body I consider that
the body can hold on to a 'spirit', whilst the body is alive and awake the two are firmly
connected. When the body is asleep I cannot guess what happens but when the body dies, the
'mechanism' of the body, holding the spirit is gone and the spirit finds a new body sooner or
later, perhaps immediately.
[48][49]
After graduating from Sherborne, Turing applied for several Cambridge colleges scholarships, including
Trinity and King's, eventually earning an £80 per annum scholarship (equivalent to about £4,300 as of
2023) to study at the latter.
[50][51] There, Turing studied the undergraduate course in Schedule B [52]
from
February 1931 to November 1934 at King's College, Cambridge, where he was awarded first-class
honours in mathematics. His dissertation, On the Gaussian error function, written during his senior year
and delivered in November 1934 (with a deadline date of 6 December) proved a version of the central
limit theorem. It was finally accepted on 16 March 1935. By spring of that same year, Turing started his

master's course (Part III)—which he completed in 1937—and,
at the same time, he published his first paper, a one-page
article called Equivalence of left and right almost periodicity
(sent on 23 April), featured in the tenth volume of the Journal
of the London Mathematical Society.
[53] Later that year,
Turing was elected a Fellow of King's College on the strength
of his dissertation[54] where he served as a lecturer.
[55]
However, and, unknown to Turing, this version of the
theorem he proved in his paper, had already been proven, in
1922, by Jarl Waldemar Lindeberg. Despite this, the
committee found Turing's methods original and so regarded
the work worthy of consideration for the fellowship. Abram
Besicovitch's report for the committee went so far as to say
that if Turing's work had been published before Lindeberg's, it
would have been "an important event in the mathematical
literature of that year".[56][57][58]
Between the springs of 1935 and 1936, at the same time as
Alonzo Church, Turing worked on the decidability of
problems, starting from Gödel's incompleteness theorems. In mid-April 1936, Turing sent Max Newman
the first draft typescript of his investigations. That same month, Church published his An Unsolvable
Problem of Elementary Number Theory, with similar conclusions to Turing's then-yet unpublished work.
Finally, on 28 May of that year, he finished and delivered his 36-page paper for publication called "On
Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem".[59][60]
It was published in the
Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society journal in two parts, the first on 30 November and the
second on 23 December.
[61]
In this paper, Turing reformulated Kurt Gödel's 1931 results on the limits of
proof and computation, replacing Gödel's universal arithmetic-based formal language with the formal and
simple hypothetical devices that became known as Turing machines. The Entscheidungsproblem
(decision problem) was originally posed by German mathematician David Hilbert in 1928. Turing proved
that his "universal computing machine" would be capable of performing any conceivable mathematical
computation if it were representable as an algorithm. He went on to prove that there was no solution to
the decision problem by first showing that the halting problem for Turing machines is undecidable: it is
not possible to decide algorithmically whether a Turing machine will ever halt. This paper has been called
"easily the most influential math paper in history".[62]
Although Turing's proof was published shortly after Church's equivalent proof using his lambda
calculus,
[63] Turing's approach is considerably more accessible and intuitive than Church's.[64]
It also
included a notion of a 'Universal Machine' (now known as a universal Turing machine), with the idea that
such a machine could perform the tasks of any other computation machine (as indeed could Church's
lambda calculus). According to the Church–Turing thesis, Turing machines and the lambda calculus are
capable of computing anything that is computable. John von Neumann acknowledged that the central
concept of the modern computer was due to Turing's paper.
[65] To this day, Turing machines are a central
object of study in theory of computation.
[66]
From September 1936 to July 1938, Turing spent most of his time studying under Church at Princeton
University,
[4]
in the second year as a Jane Eliza Procter Visiting Fellow. In addition to his purely
mathematical work, he studied cryptology and also built three of four stages of an electro-mechanical

binary multiplier.
[67]
In June 1938, he obtained his PhD from
the Department of Mathematics at Princeton;[68] his
dissertation, Systems of Logic Based on Ordinals,
[69][70]
introduced the concept of ordinal logic and the notion of
relative computing, in which Turing machines are augmented
with so-called oracles, allowing the study of problems that
cannot be solved by Turing machines. John von Neumann
wanted to hire him as his postdoctoral assistant, but he went
back to the United Kingdom.[71]
When Turing returned to Cambridge, he attended lectures
given in 1939 by Ludwig Wittgenstein about the foundations of mathematics.
[72] The lectures have been
reconstructed verbatim, including interjections from Turing and other students, from students' notes.[73]
Turing and Wittgenstein argued and disagreed, with Turing defending formalism and Wittgenstein
propounding his view that mathematics does not discover any absolute truths, but rather invents them.[74]
During the Second World War, Turing was a leading participant in the breaking of German ciphers at
Bletchley Park. The historian and wartime codebreaker Asa Briggs has said, "You needed exceptional
talent, you needed genius at Bletchley and Turing's was that genius."[75]
From September 1938, Turing worked part-time with the Government Code and Cypher School
(GC&CS), the British codebreaking organisation. He concentrated on cryptanalysis of the Enigma cipher
machine used by Nazi Germany, together with Dilly Knox, a senior GC&CS codebreaker.
[76] Soon after
the July 1939 meeting near Warsaw at which the Polish Cipher Bureau gave the British and French details
of the wiring of Enigma machine's rotors and their method of decrypting Enigma machine's messages,
Turing and Knox developed a broader solution.[77] The Polish method relied on an insecure indicator
procedure that the Germans were likely to change, which they in fact did in May 1940. Turing's approach
was more general, using crib-based decryption for which he produced the functional specification of the
bombe (an improvement on the Polish Bomba).[78]
On 4 September 1939, the day after the UK declared war on Germany, Turing reported to Bletchley Park,
the wartime station of GC&CS.[79] Like all others who came to Bletchley, he was required to sign the
Official Secrets Act, in which he agreed not to disclose anything about his work at Bletchley, with severe
legal penalties for violating the Act.[80]
Specifying the bombe was the first of five major cryptanalytical advances that Turing made during the
war. The others were: deducing the indicator procedure used by the German navy; developing a statistical
procedure dubbed Banburismus for making much more efficient use of the bombes; developing a
procedure dubbed Turingery for working out the cam settings of the wheels of the Lorenz SZ 40/42
(Tunny) cipher machine and, towards the end of the war, the development of a portable secure voice
scrambler at Hanslope Park that was codenamed Delilah.[81][82]
Career and research
Cryptanalysis
Two cottages in the stable yard at
Bletchley Park. Turing worked here in
1939 and 1940, before moving to Hut 8.
By using statistical techniques to optimise the trial of
different possibilities in the code breaking process, Turing
made an innovative contribution to the subject. He wrote two
papers discussing mathematical approaches, titled The
Applications of Probability to Cryptography[83] and Paper on
Statistics of Repetitions,
[84] which were of such value to
GC&CS and its successor GCHQ that they were not released
to the UK National Archives until April 2012, shortly before
the centenary of his birth. A GCHQ mathematician, "who
identified himself only as Richard," said at the time that the
fact that the contents had been restricted under the Official
Secrets Act for some 70 years demonstrated their importance,
and their relevance to post-war cryptanalysis:[85]
[He] said the fact that the contents had been restricted "shows what a tremendous importance it
has in the foundations of our subject". ... The papers detailed using "mathematical analysis to
try and determine which are the more likely settings so that they can be tried as quickly as
possible". ... Richard said that GCHQ had now "squeezed the juice" out of the two papers and
was "happy for them to be released into the public domain".
Turing had a reputation for eccentricity at Bletchley Park. He was known to his colleagues as "Prof" and
his treatise on Enigma was known as the "Prof's Book".[86][87] According to historian Ronald Lewin, Jack
Good, a cryptanalyst who worked with Turing, said of his colleague:
In the first week of June each year he would get a bad attack of hay fever, and he would cycle
to the office wearing a service gas mask to keep the pollen off. His bicycle had a fault: the
chain would come off at regular intervals. Instead of having it mended he would count the
number of times the pedals went round and would get off the bicycle in time to adjust the chain
by hand. Another of his eccentricities is that he chained his mug to the radiator pipes to prevent
it being stolen.[88]
Peter Hilton recounted his experience working with Turing in Hut 8 in his "Reminiscences of Bletchley
Park" from A Century of Mathematics in America:[89]
It is a rare experience to meet an authentic genius. Those of us privileged to inhabit the world
of scholarship are familiar with the intellectual stimulation furnished by talented colleagues. We
can admire the ideas they share with us and are usually able to understand their source; we may
even often believe that we ourselves could have created such concepts and originated such
thoughts. However, the experience of sharing the intellectual life of a genius is entirely
different; one realizes that one is in the presence of an intelligence, a sensibility of such
profundity and originality that one is filled with wonder and excitement. Alan Turing was such
a genius, and those, like myself, who had the astonishing and unexpected opportunity, created
by the strange exigencies of the Second World War, to be able to count Turing as colleague and
friend will never forget that experience, nor can we ever lose its immense benefit to us.

Hilton echoed similar thoughts in the Nova PBS documentary Decoding Nazi Secrets.
[90]
While working at Bletchley, Turing, who was a talented long-distance runner, occasionally ran the 40
miles (64 km) to London when he was needed for meetings,[91] and he was capable of world-class
marathon standards.[92][93] Turing tried out for the 1948 British Olympic team, but he was hampered by
an injury. His tryout time for the marathon was only 11 minutes slower than British silver medallist
Thomas Richards' Olympic race time of 2 hours 35 minutes. He was Walton Athletic Club's best runner, a
fact discovered when he passed the group while running alone.[94][95][96] When asked why he ran so hard
in training he replied:
I have such a stressful job that the only way I can get it out of my mind is by running hard; it's
the only way I can get some release.[97]
Due to the problems of counterfactual history, it is hard to estimate the precise effect Ultra intelligence
had on the war.
[98] However, official war historian Harry Hinsley estimated that this work shortened the
war in Europe by more than two years but added the caveat that this did not account for the use of the
atomic bomb and other eventualities.[99]
At the end of the war, a memo was sent to all those who had worked at Bletchley Park, reminding them
that the code of silence dictated by the Official Secrets Act did not end with the war but would continue
indefinitely.
[80] Thus, even though Turing was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire
(OBE) in 1946 by King George VI for his wartime services, his work remained secret for many
years.[100][101]
Within weeks of arriving at Bletchley Park,[79] Turing had specified an electromechanical machine called
the bombe, which could break Enigma more effectively than the Polish bomba kryptologiczna, from
which its name was derived. The bombe, with an enhancement suggested by mathematician Gordon
Welchman, became one of the primary tools, and the major automated one, used to attack Enigmaenciphered messages.[102]
The bombe searched for possible correct settings used for an
Enigma message (i.e., rotor order, rotor settings and
plugboard settings) using a suitable crib: a fragment of
probable plaintext. For each possible setting of the rotors
(which had on the order of 1019
states, or 1022
states for the
four-rotor U-boat variant),[103]
the bombe performed a chain
of logical deductions based on the crib, implemented
electromechanically.
[104]
The bombe detected when a contradiction had occurred and
ruled out that setting, moving on to the next. Most of the
possible settings would cause contradictions and be
discarded, leaving only a few to be investigated in detail. A

Kettle at Bletchley Park,

Frank, built from half a million

[110]
contradiction would occur when an enciphered letter would be turned back into the same plaintext letter,
which was impossible with the Enigma. The first bombe was installed on 18 March 1940.[105]
By late 1941, Turing and his fellow cryptanalysts Gordon Welchman, Hugh Alexander and Stuart MilnerBarry were frustrated. Building on the work of the Poles, they had set up a good working system for
decrypting Enigma signals, but their limited staff and bombes meant they could not translate all the
signals. In the summer, they had considerable success, and shipping losses had fallen to under 100,000
tons a month; however, they badly needed more resources to keep abreast of German adjustments. They
had tried to get more people and fund more bombes through the proper channels, but had failed.[106]
On 28 October they wrote directly to Winston Churchill explaining their difficulties, with Turing as the
first named. They emphasised how small their need was compared with the vast expenditure of men and
money by the forces and compared with the level of assistance they could offer to the forces.[106] As
Andrew Hodges, biographer of Turing, later wrote, "This letter had an electric effect."[107] Churchill
wrote a memo to General Ismay, which read: "ACTION THIS DAY. Make sure they have all they want
on extreme priority and report to me that this has been done." On 18 November, the chief of the secret
service reported that every possible measure was being taken.[107] The cryptographers at Bletchley Park
did not know of the Prime Minister's response, but as Milner-Barry recalled, "All that we did notice was
that almost from that day the rough ways began miraculously to be made smooth."[108] More than two
hundred bombes were in operation by the end of the war.
[109]
Turing decided to tackle the particularly difficult problem of cracking
the German naval use of Enigma "because no one else was doing
anything about it and I could have it to myself".[111]
In December
1939, Turing solved the essential part of the naval indicator system,
which was more complex than the indicator systems used by the other
services.[111][112]
That same night, he also conceived of the idea of Banburismus, a
sequential statistical technique (what Abraham Wald later called
sequential analysis) to assist in breaking the naval Enigma, "though I
was not sure that it would work in practice, and was not, in fact, sure
until some days had actually broken".
[111] For this, he invented a
measure of weight of evidence that he called the ban. Banburismus
could rule out certain sequences of the Enigma rotors, substantially
reducing the time needed to test settings on the bombes.[113] Later this
sequential process of accumulating sufficient weight of evidence using
decibans (one tenth of a ban) was used in cryptanalysis of the Lorenz
cipher.
[114]
Turing travelled to the United States in November 1942 and worked
with US Navy cryptanalysts on the naval Enigma and bombe
construction in Washington.[115][116] He also visited their Computing Machine Laboratory in Dayton,
Ohio.
[117]
Action This Day
Hut 8 and the naval Enigma
Turing's reaction to the American bombe design was far from enthusiastic:
The American Bombe programme was to produce 336 Bombes, one for each wheel order. I
used to smile inwardly at the conception of Bombe hut routine implied by this programme, but
thought that no particular purpose would be served by pointing out that we would not really use
them in that way. Their test (of commutators) can hardly be considered conclusive as they were
not testing for the bounce with electronic stop finding devices. Nobody seems to be told about
rods or offiziers or banburismus unless they are really going to do something about it.[118]
During this trip, he also assisted at Bell Labs with the development of secure speech devices.[119] He
returned to Bletchley Park in March 1943. During his absence, Hugh Alexander had officially assumed
the position of head of Hut 8, although Alexander had been de facto head for some time (Turing having
little interest in the day-to-day running of the section). Turing became a general consultant for
cryptanalysis at Bletchley Park.[120]
Alexander wrote of Turing's contribution:
There should be no question in anyone's mind that Turing's work was the biggest factor in Hut
8's success. In the early days, he was the only cryptographer who thought the problem worth
tackling and not only was he primarily responsible for the main theoretical work within the Hut,
but he also shared with Welchman and Keen the chief credit for the invention of the bombe. It
is always difficult to say that anyone is 'absolutely indispensable', but if anyone was
indispensable to Hut 8, it was Turing. The pioneer's work always tends to be forgotten when
experience and routine later make everything seem easy and many of us in Hut 8 felt that the
magnitude of Turing's contribution was never fully realised by the outside world.[121]
In July 1942, Turing devised a technique termed Turingery (or jokingly Turingismus[122]
) for use against
the Lorenz cipher messages produced by the Germans' new Geheimschreiber (secret writer) machine.
This was a teleprinter rotor cipher attachment codenamed Tunny at Bletchley Park. Turingery was a
method of wheel-breaking, i.e., a procedure for working out the cam settings of Tunny's wheels.[123] He
also introduced the Tunny team to Tommy Flowers who, under the guidance of Max Newman, went on to
build the Colossus computer, the world's first programmable digital electronic computer, which replaced
a simpler prior machine (the Heath Robinson), and whose superior speed allowed the statistical
decryption techniques to be applied usefully to the messages.[124] Some have mistakenly said that Turing
was a key figure in the design of the Colossus computer. Turingery and the statistical approach of
Banburismus undoubtedly fed into the thinking about cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher,
[125][126] but he
was not directly involved in the Colossus development.[127]
Following his work at Bell Labs in the US,[128] Turing pursued the idea of electronic enciphering of
speech in the telephone system. In the latter part of the war, he moved to work for the Secret Service's
Radio Security Service (later HMGCC) at Hanslope Park.
[129][130] At the park, he further developed his
knowledge of electronics with the assistance of REME officer Donald Bayley. Together they undertook
Turingery
Delilah
Plaque, 78 High Street, Hampton
the design and construction of a portable secure voice communications machine codenamed Delilah.
[131]
The machine was intended for different applications, but it lacked the capability for use with longdistance radio transmissions. In any case, Delilah was completed too late to be used during the war.
Though the system worked fully, with Turing demonstrating it to officials by encrypting and decrypting a
recording of a Winston Churchill speech, Delilah was not adopted for use.[132] Turing also consulted with
Bell Labs on the development of SIGSALY, a secure voice system that was used in the later years of the
war.
Between 1945 and 1947, Turing lived in Hampton,
London,[133] while he worked on the design of the ACE
(Automatic Computing Engine) at the National Physical
Laboratory (NPL). He presented a paper on 19 February
1946, which was the first detailed design of a stored-program
computer.
[134] Von Neumann's incomplete First Draft of a
Report on the EDVAC had predated Turing's paper, but it was
much less detailed and, according to John R. Womersley,
Superintendent of the NPL Mathematics Division, it "contains
a number of ideas which are Dr. Turing's own".[135]
Although ACE was a feasible design, the effect of the Official
Secrets Act surrounding the wartime work at Bletchley Park
made it impossible for Turing to explain the basis of his
analysis of how a computer installation involving human
operators would work.[136] This led to delays in starting the project and he became disillusioned. In late
1947 he returned to Cambridge for a sabbatical year during which he produced a seminal work on
Intelligent Machinery that was not published in his lifetime.[137] While he was at Cambridge, the Pilot
ACE was being built in his absence. It executed its first program on 10 May 1950, and a number of later
computers around the world owe much to it, including the English Electric DEUCE and the American
Bendix G-15. The full version of Turing's ACE was not built until after his death.[138]
According to the memoirs of the German computer pioneer Heinz Billing from the Max Planck Institute
for Physics, published by Genscher, Düsseldorf, there was a meeting between Turing and Konrad
Zuse.
[139]
It took place in Göttingen in 1947. The interrogation had the form of a colloquium. Participants
were Womersley, Turing, Porter from England and a few German researchers like Zuse, Walther, and
Billing (for more details see Herbert Bruderer, Konrad Zuse und die Schweiz).
In 1948, Turing was appointed reader in the Mathematics Department at the University of Manchester. He
lived at "Copper Folly", 43 Adlington Road, in Wilmslow.
[140] A year later, he became deputy director of
the Computing Machine Laboratory, where he worked on software for one of the earliest stored-program
computers—the Manchester Mark 1. Turing wrote the first version of the Programmer's Manual for this
machine, and was recruited by Ferranti as a consultant in the development of their commercialised
machine, the Ferranti Mark 1. He continued to be paid consultancy fees by Ferranti until his death.[141]
During this time, he continued to do more abstract work in mathematics,[142] and in "Computing
Machinery and Intelligence",[143] Turing addressed the problem of artificial intelligence, and proposed an
experiment that became known as the Turing test, an attempt to define a standard for a machine to be

called "intelligent". The idea was that a computer could be
said to "think" if a human interrogator could not tell it apart,
through conversation, from a human being.[144]
In the paper,
Turing suggested that rather than building a program to
simulate the adult mind, it would be better to produce a
simpler one to simulate a child's mind and then to subject it to
a course of education. A reversed form of the Turing test is
widely used on the Internet; the CAPTCHA test is intended to
determine whether the user is a human or a computer.
In 1948, Turing, working with his former undergraduate
colleague, D.G. Champernowne, began writing a chess
program for a computer that did not yet exist. By 1950, the
program was completed and dubbed the Turochamp.
[145]
In
1952, he tried to implement it on a Ferranti Mark 1, but
lacking enough power, the computer was unable to execute
the program. Instead, Turing "ran" the program by flipping
through the pages of the algorithm and carrying out its
instructions on a chessboard, taking about half an hour per move. The game was recorded.[146] According
to Garry Kasparov, Turing's program "played a recognizable game of chess".[147] The program lost to
Turing's colleague Alick Glennie, although it is said that it won a game against Champernowne's wife,
Isabel.[148]
His Turing test was a significant, characteristically provocative, and lasting contribution to the debate
regarding artificial intelligence, which continues after more than half a century.
[149]
When Turing was 39 years old in 1951, he turned to mathematical biology, finally publishing his
masterpiece "The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis" in January 1952. He was interested in
morphogenesis, the development of patterns and shapes in biological organisms. He suggested that a
system of chemicals reacting with each other and diffusing across space, termed a reaction–diffusion
system, could account for "the main phenomena of morphogenesis".[150] He used systems of partial
differential equations to model catalytic chemical reactions. For example, if a catalyst A is required for a
certain chemical reaction to take place, and if the reaction produced more of the catalyst A, then we say
that the reaction is autocatalytic, and there is positive feedback that can be modelled by nonlinear
differential equations. Turing discovered that patterns could be created if the chemical reaction not only
produced catalyst A, but also produced an inhibitor B that slowed down the production of A. If A and B
then diffused through the container at different rates, then you could have some regions where A
dominated and some where B did. To calculate the extent of this, Turing would have needed a powerful
computer, but these were not so freely available in 1951, so he had to use linear approximations to solve
the equations by hand. These calculations gave the right qualitative results, and produced, for example, a
uniform mixture that oddly enough had regularly spaced fixed red spots. The Russian biochemist Boris
Belousov had performed experiments with similar results, but could not get his papers published because
of the contemporary prejudice that any such thing violated the second law of thermodynamics. Belousov
was not aware of Turing's paper in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society.
[151]
Pattern formation and mathematical biology
Although published before the structure and role of DNA was understood, Turing's work on
morphogenesis remains relevant today and is considered a seminal piece of work in mathematical
biology.
[152] One of the early applications of Turing's paper was the work by James Murray explaining
spots and stripes on the fur of cats, large and small.[153][154][155] Further research in the area suggests that
Turing's work can partially explain the growth of "feathers, hair follicles, the branching pattern of lungs,
and even the left-right asymmetry that puts the heart on the left side of the chest".[156]
In 2012, Sheth, et
al. found that in mice, removal of Hox genes causes an increase in the number of digits without an
increase in the overall size of the limb, suggesting that Hox genes control digit formation by tuning the
wavelength of a Turing-type mechanism.[157] Later papers were not available until Collected Works of
A. M. Turing was published in 1992.[158]
A study conducted in 2023 confirmed Turing's mathematical model hypothesis. Presented by the
American Physical Society, the experiment involved growing chia seeds in even layers within trays, later
adjusting the available moisture. Researchers experimentally tweaked the factors which appear in the
Turing equations, and, as a result, patterns resembling those seen in natural environments emerged. This
is believed to be the first time that experiments with living vegetation have verified Turing's mathematical
insight.[159][160]
In the 1940s, Turing became worried about losing his savings in the event of a German invasion. In order
to protect it, he bought two silver bars weighing 3,200 oz (90 kg) and worth £250 (in 2022, £8,000
adjusted for inflation, £48,000 at spot price) and buried them in a wood near Bletchley Park.[161] Upon
returning to dig them up, Turing found that he was unable to break his own code describing where exactly
he had hidden them. This, along with the fact that the area had been renovated, meant that he never
regained the silver.
[162]
In 1941, Turing proposed marriage to Hut 8 colleague Joan Clarke, a fellow mathematician and
cryptanalyst, but their engagement was short-lived. After admitting his homosexuality to his fiancée, who
was reportedly "unfazed" by the revelation, Turing decided that he could not go through with the
marriage.[163]
In December 1951, Turing met Arnold Murray, a 19-year-old unemployed man. Turing was walking
along Manchester's Oxford Road when he met Murray just outside the Regal Cinema and invited him to
lunch. The two agreed to meet again and in January 1952 began an intimate relationship.[164] On 23
January, Turing's house in Wilmslow was burgled. Murray told Turing that he and the burglar were
acquainted, and Turing reported the crime to the police. During the investigation, he acknowledged a
sexual relationship with Murray. Homosexual acts were criminal offences in the United Kingdom at that
time,[165] and both men were charged with "gross indecency" under Section 11 of the Criminal Law

Initial committal proceedings for
the trial were held on 27 February during which Turing's
solicitor "reserved his defence", i.e., did not argue or provide
evidence against the allegations. The proceedings were held
at the Sessions House in Knutsford.
[167]
Turing was later convinced by the advice of his brother and
his own solicitor, and he entered a plea of guilty.
[168] The
case, Regina v. Turing and Murray, was brought to trial on 31
March 1952.[169] Turing was convicted and given a choice
between imprisonment and probation. His probation would be
conditional on his agreement to undergo hormonal physical
changes designed to reduce libido, known as "chemical
castration".[170] He accepted the option of injections of what
was then called stilboestrol (now known as diethylstilbestrol
or DES), a synthetic oestrogen; this feminization of his body was continued for the course of one year.
The treatment rendered Turing impotent and caused breast tissue to form.
[171]
In a letter, Turing wrote
that "no doubt I shall emerge from it all a different man, but quite who I've not found out".[172][173]
Murray was given a conditional discharge.[174]
Turing's conviction led to the removal of his security clearance and barred him from continuing with his
cryptographic consultancy for GCHQ, the British signals intelligence agency that had evolved from
GC&CS in 1946, though he kept his academic post. His trial took place only months after the defection to
the Soviet Union of Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean, in summer 1951, after which the Foreign Office
started to consider anyone known to be homosexual as a potential security risk.[175]
Turing was denied entry into the United States after his conviction in 1952, but was free to visit other
European countries.[176]
In the summer of 1952 he visited Norway which was more tolerant of
homosexuals. Among the various men he met there was one named Kjell Carlson. Kjell intended to visit
Turing in the UK but the authorities intercepted Kjell's postcard detailing his travel arrangements and
were able to intercept and deport him before the two could meet.[177]
It was also during this time that
Turing started consulting a psychiatrist, Dr Franz Greenbaum, with whom he got on well and who
subsequently became a family friend.[177][178]
On 8 June 1954, at his house at 43 Adlington Road, Wilmslow, Turing's housekeeper found him dead.[179]
A post mortem was held that evening, which determined that he had died the previous day at age 41 with
cyanide poisoning cited as the cause of death.[180][181] When his body was discovered, an apple lay halfeaten beside his bed, and although the apple was not tested for cyanide,[182]
it was speculated that this
was the means by which Turing had consumed a fatal dose.
Turing's brother, John, identified the body the following day and took the advice given by Dr. Greenbaum
to accept the verdict of the inquest, as there was little prospect of establishing that the death was
accidental.[183] The inquest was held the following day, which determined the cause of death to be
suicide.[170] Turing's remains were cremated at Woking Crematorium just two days later on 12 June 1954,
Death

with just his mother, brother, and Lyn Newman
attending,[184][185] and his ashes were scattered in the gardens
of the crematorium, just as his father's had been.[186] Turing's
mother was on holiday in Italy at the time of his death and
returned home after the inquest. She never accepted the
verdict of suicide.[183]
Philosopher Jack Copeland has questioned various aspects of
the coroner's historical verdict. He suggested an alternative
explanation for the cause of Turing's death: the accidental
inhalation of cyanide fumes from an apparatus used to
electroplate gold onto spoons. The potassium cyanide was
used to dissolve the gold. Turing had such an apparatus set up
in his tiny spare room. Copeland noted that the autopsy
findings were more consistent with inhalation than with
ingestion of the poison. Turing also habitually ate an apple
before going to bed, and it was not unusual for the apple to be discarded half-eaten.[15] Furthermore,
Turing had reportedly borne his legal setbacks and hormone treatment (which had been discontinued a
year previously) "with good humour" and had shown no sign of despondency before his death. He even
set down a list of tasks that he intended to complete upon returning to his office after the holiday
weekend.[15] Turing's mother believed that the ingestion was accidental, resulting from her son's careless
storage of laboratory chemicals.[187] Turing biographer Andrew Hodges theorised that Turing deliberately
made his death look accidental in order to shield his mother from the knowledge that he had killed
himself.[188]
Doubts on the suicide thesis have been also cast by John W. Dawson Jr. who, in his review of Hodges'
book, recalls "Turing's vulnerable position in the Cold War political climate" and points out that "Turing
was found dead by a maid, who discovered him 'lying neatly in his bed'—hardly what one would expect
of "a man fighting for life against the suffocation induced by cyanide poisoning." Turing had given no
hint of suicidal inclinations to his friends and had made no effort to put his affairs in order.
[189]
Hodges and a later biographer, David Leavitt, have both speculated that Turing was re-enacting a scene
from the Walt Disney film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937), his favourite fairy tale. Both men
noted that (in Leavitt's words) he took "an especially keen pleasure in the scene where the Wicked Queen
immerses her apple in the poisonous brew".[190]
It has also been suggested that Turing's belief in fortune-telling may have caused his depressed mood.[186]
As a youth, Turing had been told by a fortune-teller that he would be a genius. In mid-May 1954, shortly
before his death, Turing again decided to consult a fortune-teller during a day-trip to St Annes-on-Sea
with the Greenbaum family.
[186] According to the Greenbaums' daughter, Barbara:[178]
But it was a lovely sunny day and Alan was in a cheerful mood and off we went ... Then he
thought it would be a good idea to go to the Pleasure Beach at Blackpool. We found a fortuneteller's tent and Alan said he'd like to go in[,] so we waited around for him to come back ... And
this sunny, cheerful visage had shrunk into a pale, shaking, horror-stricken face. Something had
happened. We don't know what the fortune-teller said but he obviously was deeply unhappy. I
think that was probably the last time we saw him before we heard of his suicide.
Turing's OBE currently held in Sherborne
School archives
In August 2009, British programmer John Graham-Cumming
started a petition urging the British government to apologise
for Turing's prosecution as a homosexual.[191][192] The
petition received more than 30,000 signatures.[193][194] The
prime minister, Gordon Brown, acknowledged the petition,
releasing a statement on 10 September 2009 apologising and
describing the treatment of Turing as "appalling":[193][195]
Thousands of people have come together to demand
justice for Alan Turing and recognition of the
appalling way he was treated. While Turing was
dealt with under the law of the time and we can't
put the clock back, his treatment was of course
utterly unfair and I am pleased to have the chance
to say how deeply sorry I and we all are for what
happened to him ... So on behalf of the British
government, and all those who live freely thanks to
Alan's work I am very proud to say: we're sorry,
you deserved so much better.
[193][196]
In December 2011, William Jones and his member of Parliament, John Leech, created an e-petition[197]
requesting that the British government pardon Turing for his conviction of "gross indecency":[198]
We ask the HM Government to grant a pardon to Alan Turing for the conviction of "gross
indecency". In 1952, he was convicted of "gross indecency" with another man and was forced
to undergo so-called "organo-therapy"—chemical castration. Two years later, he killed himself
with cyanide, aged just 41. Alan Turing was driven to a terrible despair and early death by the
nation he'd done so much to save. This remains a shame on the British government and British
history. A pardon can go some way to healing this damage. It may act as an apology to many of
the other gay men, not as well-known as Alan Turing, who were subjected to these laws.[197]
The petition gathered over 37,000 signatures,[197][199] and was submitted to Parliament by the
Manchester MP John Leech but the request was discouraged by Justice Minister Lord McNally, who
said:[200]
A posthumous pardon was not considered appropriate as Alan Turing was properly convicted of
what at the time was a criminal offence. He would have known that his offence was against the
law and that he would be prosecuted. It is tragic that Alan Turing was convicted of an offence
that now seems both cruel and absurd—particularly poignant given his outstanding contribution
to the war effort. However, the law at the time required a prosecution and, as such, longGovernment apology and pardon
standing policy has been to accept that such convictions took place and, rather than trying to
alter the historical context and to put right what cannot be put right, ensure instead that we
never again return to those times.[201]
John Leech, the MP for Manchester Withington (2005–15), submitted several bills to Parliament[202] and
led a high-profile campaign to secure the pardon. Leech made the case in the House of Commons that
Turing's contribution to the war made him a national hero and that it was "ultimately just embarrassing"
that the conviction still stood.[203] Leech continued to take the bill through Parliament and campaigned
for several years, gaining the public support of numerous leading scientists, including Stephen
Hawking.
[204][205] At the British premiere of a film based on Turing's life, The Imitation Game, the
producers thanked Leech for bringing the topic to public attention and securing Turing's pardon.[206]
Leech is now regularly described as the "architect" of Turing's pardon and subsequently the Alan Turing
Law which went on to secure pardons for 75,000 other men and women convicted of similar
crimes.[207][208][209]
On 26 July 2012, a bill was introduced in the House of Lords to grant a statutory pardon to Turing for
offences under section 11 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885, of which he was convicted on 31
March 1952.[210] Late in the year in a letter to The Daily Telegraph, the physicist Stephen Hawking and
10 other signatories including the Astronomer Royal Lord Rees, President of the Royal Society Sir Paul
Nurse, Lady Trumpington (who worked for Turing during the war) and Lord Sharkey (the bill's sponsor)
called on Prime Minister David Cameron to act on the pardon request.[211] The government indicated it
would support the bill,[212][213][214]
 and it passed its third reading in the House of Lords in October.
[215]
At the bill's second reading in the House of Commons on 29 November 2013, Conservative MP
Christopher Chope objected to the bill, delaying its passage. The bill was due to return to the House of
Commons on 28 February 2014,[216] but before the bill could be debated in the House of Commons,[217]
the government elected to proceed under the royal prerogative of mercy. On 24 December 2013, Queen
Elizabeth II signed a pardon for Turing's conviction for "gross indecency", with immediate effect.[218]
Announcing the pardon, Lord Chancellor Chris Grayling said Turing deserved to be "remembered and
recognised for his fantastic contribution to the war effort" and not for his later criminal
conviction.[199][219] The Queen pronounced Turing pardoned in August 2014.[220]
It was only the fourth
royal pardon granted since the conclusion of the Second World War.
[221] Pardons are normally granted
only when the person is technically innocent, and a request has been made by the family or other
interested party; neither condition was met in regard to Turing's conviction.[222]
In September 2016, the government announced its intention to expand this retroactive exoneration to
other men convicted of similar historical indecency offences, in what was described as an "Alan Turing
law".[223][224] The Alan Turing law is now an informal term for the law in the United Kingdom, contained
in the Policing and Crime Act 2017, which serves as an amnesty law to retroactively pardon men who
were cautioned or convicted under historical legislation that outlawed homosexual acts. The law applies
in England and Wales.[225]
On 19 July 2023, following an apology to LGBT veterans from the UK Government, Defence Secretary
Ben Wallace suggested Turing should be honoured with a permanent statue on the fourth plinth of
Trafalgar Square, describing Turing as "probably the greatest war hero, in my book, of the Second World
War, [whose] achievements shortened the war, saved thousands of lives, helped defeat the Nazis. And his
story is a sad story of a society and how it treated him."[226][227][228]

his colleagues at Bletchley Park had used to break into the German Enigma cipher systems.
At Bletchley it was known as 'the Prof's Book.' A copy of this handbook was at last released
from secrecy by the American National Security Agency in April 1996, under the title Turing's
Treatise on the Enigma. Subsequently, a much better original copy was released by the
(British) National Archives, box HW 25/3. This also revealed a title which had been lost in
the American copy: Mathematical theory of ENIGMA machine. (Though, oddly, the report
does not actually have any mathematical theory.)"

Turing, Sara Stoney (1959). Alan M Turing. W Heffer. Turing's mother, who survived him by
many years, wrote this 157-page biography of her son, glorifying his life. It was published in
1959, and so could not cover his war work. Scarcely 300 copies were sold (Sara Turing to
Lyn Newman, 1967, Library of St John's College, Cambridge). The six-page foreword by Lyn
Irvine includes reminiscences and is more frequently quoted. It was re-published by
Cambridge University Press in 2012, to honour the centenary of his birth, and included a
new foreword by Martin Davis, as well as a never-before-published memoir by Turing's older
brother John F. Turing.
